# User-Based Collaborative Filtering

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a **User-Based Collaborative Filtering** recommendation system. It focuses on suggesting items to users based on the preferences of other users with similar tastes.

## 📚 Overview

Collaborative filtering is one of the most common approaches in recommender systems. This project specifically implements **user-based collaborative filtering**, which compares users and recommends items that similar users liked.

### ✅ Features

- Computes user similarity using cosine similarity
- Predicts ratings for unseen items
- Recommends top-N items
- Works with user-item interaction data
- Easily extendable to item-based filtering

## 🧠 Algorithms & Concepts

- **User Similarity**: Cosine similarity or Pearson correlation
- **Neighborhood-Based Filtering**: Finds nearest neighbors
- **Top-N Recommendation**: Filters and ranks items
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles sparse matrices and missing values

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
